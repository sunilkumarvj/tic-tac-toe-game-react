## Demo of the tic-tac-toe game: https://sunilkumarvj.github.io/tic-tac-toe-game-react/

## Available Components

In this project, I have used four components:

### `Board`

This component returns the 9 squares of the board.<br />

### `Square`

This component returns the button. After clicking the button it returns the player moves value.<br />

### `Game`

This component contains the player 'status' and 'moves'.<br />

Here the players are 'X' and 'O'. <br />

### `calculateWinner`

This component contains the calculation of the winner with respect to their moves.<br />


In this game there are two players will clicks any squares of the board with respect to one after another. 
The winner will be declared with respect to their moves.<br />
